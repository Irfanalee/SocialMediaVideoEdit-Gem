**Quick Fix: Clear Browser Cache**

The new UI is deployed but your browser is showing cached content. Please try these steps:

### Option 1: Hard Refresh (Recommended)
- **Windows/Linux**: Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` or `Ctrl + F5`
- **Mac**: Press `Cmd + Shift + R`

### Option 2: Clear Cache Manually
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

### Option 3: Incognito/Private Window
- Open `http://localhost:3000` in an incognito/private window

### What You Should See After Refresh:
1. **Two tabs** at the top: "New Upload" | "Video Library"
2. After uploading: **Video Information card** with duration, size, FPS, etc.
3. During processing: **Activity Timeline** + **Real-time Logs**

If you still don't see the new UI after trying these steps, let me know!
